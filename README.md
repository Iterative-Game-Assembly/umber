# Codename Umber

## What is This?
The second project created through an open development collaboration. Anyone is free to join in by providing assets, submitting patches, or contributing to the discussion.

[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/XQbCY3)

## Process
The direction of the game is decided by a democratic process among the members. Discussion happens via the discord server, with larger subjects taking the form of threaded conversation via [issues](https://github.com/Iterative-Game-Assembly/umber/issues).

At the end of the allotted time the project will enter a "maintenance mode" where contributions will continue to be accepted but a new project will be started so that fresh concepts can be introduced.
